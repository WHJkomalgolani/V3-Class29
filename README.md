To do list:
C29 - 
1)create the ground body from Ground class.

2)create the rope object and hang it on a
point in the canvas, then we will create a fruit body and
attach it with the rope.

3)In our game, the rope we are creating is made up of
multiple rectangles, hence we call it a composite. But we
also have to add our fruit in the same composite.
To add a body to the composite, we use the function,
Matter.Composite.add(name_of_composite,
body_to_add).

4)Because we have not added any constraint between the
fruit body and the rope. They are part of the same
composite but not attached to each other with any
constraint
